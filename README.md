# National-Citizen-Registry

# Problem Definition: National Citizen Registry Management

# Objective: 
 
Create a PL/SQL program to manage a simple registry of citizens. The program will demonstrate the use of:

- Records: To store all related information about a single citizen.
- Collections (Associative Arrays & Nested Tables): To manage multiple citizen records.
- GOTO Statement: To implement a simple control flow for error handling.

# Scenario
The government needs to track its citizens. For each citizen, we store:
- National ID Number
- Full Name  
- Date of Birth
- Province of Residence

# System Capabilities
The system should be able to:
- Add new citizens to the registry.
- Search for a citizen by their National ID and display their full details.
- List all citizens from a specific province.
